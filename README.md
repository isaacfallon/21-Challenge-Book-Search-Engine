## Description
            
This project is refactored Google Books API search engine to now use a GraphQL API and Apollo Server.

I built this application as a way to increase its functionality from a developer's perspective by using more modern technologies as a base.

By completing this project, I have a better understanding of how to effectively refactor an application and how to implement GraphQL API and an Apollo Server.
